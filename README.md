## How To Use **_FreeHand_** :
- Mouse Move == Palm Gesture
- Mouse Click == Fist Gesture
```
FreeHand is an Open Source Computer Vision program that tracks the user's hand, and assigns it computer mouse 
properties. Freehand utilizes the computer's front facing camera and uses Haard Cascade Classifiers to assign
a mousemove to the user's palm and a mouseclick to the user's fist. The user has to utilize both the hand and
fist to run the program. Freehand currently has 3 different entertainment options to explore:
```
- Paint
- Piano
- Calculator

###### Paint
```
The Paint application creates an empty canvas in which you can use FreeHands tracking system to create artwork;
There are several options for colors that you can choose from by simply dragging your (hand)mouse to the
designated area that contains the different colors.
```
###### Piano
```
The Piano application has a OpenCV generated keyboard with specific notes assigned to each key. All you have to
to play music is use the (hand)mouse gestures to hover above the wanted keys. The avaliable notes are as follows:

- A2      - Bf      - Cs      - Ds      - E      - Fs      - G
- Af      - B       - C       - D                - F
- A
```
###### Calculator
```
The Calculator application also utilizes FreeHand's tracking system to perform simple mathematical operations such
as:

- Addition
- Multiplication
- Subtraction
- Division
```

### Future Work
```
Some future work that the group would like to work on is adding different entertainment applications that utilize
OpenCV's great functionality. A certain project that was discussed but time did not allow for us too finish, is a
face swap feature that recognizes 2 or more human faces and swaps them in real time video capture. Optimizing the
application to run using too much CPU power is also a future feature that would be beneficial to this project; 
using less computer while running much faster and smoother would be ideal for this project.
